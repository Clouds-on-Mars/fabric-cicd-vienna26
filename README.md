# Git and CI/CD Mastery Inside Fabric Data Engineering

## 🎯 Data Community Day Vienna 2026 — Workshop Guide

Welcome to the hands-on workshop! This guide will walk you through implementing enterprise-grade DevOps practices for Microsoft Fabric. Follow each module step-by-step to complete all exercises successfully.

### What You'll Build

You'll implement a complete data engineering solution with professional DevOps practices:
- **Medallion Architecture**: Bronze → Silver data layers using Microsoft Fabric Lakehouses
- **Version Control**: Full Git integration for all Fabric artifacts
- **CI/CD Automation**: Automated deployments across dev, test, and production environments
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Handle schema changes, data migrations, and cross-environment promotions

### Who This Workshop Is For

Whether you're a data engineer, architect, or DevOps practitioner, this workshop will equip you with the skills to confidently manage Fabric-based solutions at scale. No prior Fabric CI/CD experience required, but basic familiarity with Microsoft Fabric and Git concepts is helpful.

   - Python 3.12+ installed
   - Git command line tools
   - VS Code with Python and Fabric extensions (recommended)
4. **Permissions**:
   - Fabric workspace admin rights
   - Repository write access

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will:

- Build a complete Data Engineering solution with Microsoft Fabric git and deployment pipelines  
- Configure Fabric workspaces for Git integration and synchronization
