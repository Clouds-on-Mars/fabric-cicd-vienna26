## Quick Pre-flight Check

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Internet access to GitHub and Microsoft Fabric
- Admin rights to install software on your machine
-  Workshop credentials (provided by instructor)
- 30 minutes of uninterrupted time

> [!TIP]
> **Pro Tip:** Use an incognito/private browser window to avoid conflicts with existing work accounts. This prevents automatic redirects and makes login smoother.

---

## Exercise 1: Install Git (5 minutes)

> **Goal:** Install Git version control system on your machine.
>
> Git is your version control system - essential for tracking changes and collaborating on code.

Git is essential for version control and CI/CD workflows.

### Windows (WSL)
1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) if not already installed:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
2. Open WSL terminal and install Git:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install git
   ```
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

### macOS
1. Install using Homebrew (recommended):
   ```bash
   brew install git
   ```
   Or download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
git --version
```

> [!TIP]
> If you already have Git installed, ensure it's version 2.25 or later for optimal compatibility with Microsoft Fabric git integration.

### ✅ Exercise 1 Checkpoint

**Before continuing, verify:**
- [ ] Git is installed (`git --version` shows 2.25+)
- [ ] Git works from command line/terminal
- [ ] You understand basic Git concepts

**Exercise 1 Complete!** Git is ready for version control.

---

## Exercise 2: Install Python & Workshop Tools (10 minutes)

> **Goal:** Set up Python environment with fabric-cli and fabric-cicd packages.
>
> Python powers the fabric-cli and fabric-cicd tools you'll use throughout the workshop.

Python is required for fabric-cli and fabric-cicd automation tools.

### Windows (WSL)
1. Open WSL terminal and install Python:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv python3-pip
   ```
2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   pip3 --version
   ```

### macOS
1. Install using Homebrew (recommended):
   ```bash
   brew install python@3.11
   ```
   Or download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   pip3 --version
   ```

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv python3-pip
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

### Set Up Your Workshop Environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A virtual environment keeps workshop packages isolated from your system Python.

1. **Create your workshop environment:**
   ```bash
   # Windows (WSL)
   python3 -m venv fabric-de-workshop
   source fabric-de-workshop/bin/activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv fabric-de-workshop
   source fabric-de-workshop/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install the workshop tools:**
   ```bash
   pip install ms-fabric-cli fabric-cicd
   ```
   
   This installs:
   - **fabric-cli**: Command-line tool for Fabric operations
   - **fabric-cicd**: Python library for CI/CD automation

3. **Verify everything works:**

   **Test fabric-cicd library import:**
   ```bash
   python
   ```
   
   In the Python interpreter, run:
   ```python
   from fabric_cicd import FabricWorkspace
   print("✅ fabric-cicd imported successfully!")
   exit()
   ```

   **Test fabric-cli command:**
   ```bash
   fab --version
   ```

   Expected output (version may vary):
   ```
   Fabric CLI version X.X.X
   ```

   Any version 1.0.0 or higher is fine!

   If both tests pass, your installation is complete! If you encounter errors, refer to the Troubleshooting section below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep your virtual environment activated for the duration of the workshop. You'll need to reactivate it if you open a new terminal session.

### ✅ Exercise 2 Checkpoint

**Before continuing, verify:**
- [ ] Python 3.11+ installed (`python3 --version`)
- [ ] Virtual environment created and activated
- [ ] fabric-cli installed (`fab --version` works)
- [ ] fabric-cicd imported successfully in Python
- [ ] Terminal shows `(fabric-de-workshop)` prefix

 **Exercise 2 Complete!** Python environment is configured.

---

## Exercise 3: Install Visual Studio Code (5 minutes)

> **Goal:** Install and configure VSCode as your development environment.
>
> VSCode is your development environment where you'll write code and manage Git operations.

VSCode will be our primary development environment for the workshop.

### All Platforms
1. Download VSCode from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install with default settings
3. **Install the Python extension:**
   - Open VSCode
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Python" by Microsoft
   - Click "Install"

4. **Configure Python interpreter:**
   - Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
   - Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
   - Choose the interpreter from your `fabric-de-workshop` virtual environment

> [!TIP]
> VSCode will automatically detect your virtual environment if you open a terminal within VSCode after activating it.

### ✅ Exercise 3 Checkpoint

**Before continuing, verify:**
- [ ] VSCode is installed and opens correctly
- [ ] Python extension is installed
- [ ] Python interpreter is configured
- [ ] You can open integrated terminal (Ctrl+`)

**Exercise 3 Complete!** VSCode is ready for development.

## Troubleshooting Guide

> [!TIP]
> Most issues can be resolved quickly. Check these common problems first:

#### Python/pip not found
**Problem**: `python` or `pip` command not recognized
**Solution**: 
- Windows (WSL): Use `python3` and `pip3` instead of `python` and `pip`
- macOS/Linux: Use `python3` and `pip3` instead of `python` and `pip`

#### fabric-cli installation fails
**Problem**: Permission errors during `pip install`
**Solution**:
```bash
# Use --user flag if virtual environment isn't working
pip install --user ms-fabric-cli fabric-cicd

# Or try upgrading pip first
pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Git clone fails
**Problem**: Repository clone fails or access denied
**Solution**:
- Verify internet connection
- Check GitHub account permissions
- Try HTTPS clone instead of SSH

#### VSCode Python interpreter not found
**Problem**: VSCode can't find Python interpreter
**Solution**:
- Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
- Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
- Browse and select your virtual environment's Python executable

### Getting Help
- **fabric-cli**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cli/issues)
- **fabric-cicd**: [GitHub Documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cicd)
- **Workshop specific**: Ask your instructor or check the troubleshooting sections in subsequent labs

## Resync if You're Behind (Module 1)

If your setup feels messy or something failed:

1. **Check your virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # If you don't see (fabric-de-workshop) in your prompt:
   source fabric-de-workshop/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Verify core tools**
   ```bash
   git --version
   python3 --version
   fab --version
   ```
3. **Re-open the repo in VS Code**
   - Close VS Code
   - Reopen it and open the `Fabric-DE-CICD` folder
   - Open the integrated terminal and reactivate the virtualenv

If this doesn't fix the problem, go to [`troubleshooting.md`](../troubleshooting.md) → *Setup Issues* and ask an instructor.
